<h1>Urease Inhibitor</h1>
<p>These chemical compounds block the activity of the enzyme urease. Urease is found in soil as well as in plant residues. Urease, along with water, will hydrolyze, or break down, urea into ammonium. The loss process that urease inhibitors protect against is ammonia volatilization. With high pH soil, or soil/residue environments that are poorly buffered against an increase in pH, the rapid hydrolysis of urea will result in an accumulation of ammonia (NH3) rather than ammonium.

    Ammonia can be lost to the atmosphere as a gas. Under worst-case conditions, this loss can be rapid and significant. Research studies have found greater than 50% of applied fertilizer N lost to the atmosphere under these conditions. By keeping urea from hydrolyzing, urease inhibitors protect against ammonia volatilization, keeping fertilizer N in the urea form.
    
    Since urea is very water soluble, such inhibition allows time for rainfall or irrigation to move urea into the soil. Once incorporated into the soil, to a depth of just 2-3 inches, urea-N is protected from ammonia volatilization, because ammonium that is released through hydrolysis is quickly held on soil cation exchange sites. Urease inhibitors break down with time, but typically can protect against ammonia loss from surface applied fertilizers for a couple of weeks, depending on temperature and moisture conditions.</p>

<h1>Nitrification Inhibitors</h1>
<p>These chemical compounds temporarily reduce populations of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter bacteria in soil. These are the bacteria responsible for converting ammonium to nitrite (Nitrosomonas) and nitrite to nitrate (Nitrobacter). These compounds protect against both denitrification and leaching by retaining fertilizer N in the ammonium form. Ammonium (NH4+) is a positively charged ion (cation) which can be held on negatively charged exchange sites in soil – present in clays and organic matter. This negatively charged anion nitrate (NO3-) can be converted to N2O or N2 gases with anaerobic (waterlogged) conditions, or can leach below the root zone with rain with well-drained soils.

    Products with known efficacy for inhibiting nitrification are dicyandiamide (DCD), nitrapyrin, and pronitradine. Nitrapyrin has long been sold as N-Serve™ and Instinct™, and pronitradine has recently come into the market with the tradename Centuro™. Nitrapyrin and DCD are not patent protected, and may be found in a variety of products. Nitrification inhibitors, like urease inhibitors, will break down over time and will no longer be effective. The rate of breakdown is influenced particularly by temperature, so these products generally remain effective longer at cooler soil temperatures, with efficacy ranging from two to several weeks.</p>
