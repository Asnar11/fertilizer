<h1>Micro Nutrient</h1>
<p>MICRONUTRIENT NUTRITION
    Through increased use of soil testing and plant analyses, micronutrient deficiencies have been verified in many soils. Some reasons limiting the incidental additions of micronutrients include:
    
    High-yield crop demands remove micronutrients from the soil
    
    Increased use of high-analysis NPK fertilizers containing lower quantities of micronutrient contaminants
    
    Advances in fertilizer technology reduce the residual addition of micronutrients.
    
     
    
    These factors contribute to the significant increase in usage of and need for micronutrients in order to achieve full balanced nutrition.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Boron</h1>
<p>Boron (B) exists primarily in soil solutions as the BO₃⁻³ anion – the form commonly taken up by plants. One of the most important micronutrients affecting membrane stability, B supports the structural and functional integrity of plant cell membranes. Boron-deficiency symptoms first appear at the growing points, and certain soil types are more prone to boron deficiencies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Copper</h1>
<p>Copper (Cu) activates enzymes and catalyzes reactions in several plant-growth processes. The presence of copper is closely linked to Vitamin A production, and it helps ensure successful protein synthesis.Recommended copper rates range from 3 to 10 lb/acre as CuSO₄ or finely ground CuO. Residual effects of applied copper are very marked, with responses being noted up to eight years after application. Because of these residual effects, soil tests are essential to monitor possible copper accumulations to toxic levels in soils where copper fertilizers are being applied.

    Plant analyses also can be used to monitor copper levels in plant tissues. Copper applications should be decreased or discontinued when available levels increase beyond the deficiency range</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Iron</h1>
<p>Iron (Fe) is essential for crop growth and food production. Plants take up Fe as the ferrous (Fe²⁺) cation. Iron is a component of many enzymes associated with energy transfer, nitrogen reduction and fixation, and lignin formation.
    Soil applications of most iron sources generally are not effective for crops, so foliar sprays are the recommended application method. Spray applications of a 3 to 4% FeSO₄ solution at 20 to 40 gallons/acre are used to correct iron deficiencies. The application rate should be high enough to wet the foliage.

More than one foliar application may be required for correction of iron chlorosis. Inclusion of a sticker-spreader agent in the spray is suggested to improve adherence of the spray to the plant foliage for increased iron absorption by the plant.

<br>
<br>
<h1>Manganese</h1>
<p>Manganese (Mn) functions primarily as part of enzyme systems in plants. It activates several important metabolic reactions and plays a direct role in photosynthesis. Manganese accelerates germination and maturity while increasing the availability of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca).Recommended application rates range from 2 to 20 lb/acre of manganese, generally as MnSO₄. Application rates of MnO would be similar if applied as a fine powder or in NPK fertilizers. Band application of manganese sources with acid-forming fertilizers results in a more efficient use of applied manganese because the rate of oxidation of applied manganese to the unavailable tetravalent form (as in MnO₂) is decreased.

    There are no residual effects of applied manganese for the same reason, so annual applications are needed. Foliar spray applications of MnSO₄ also are used and require lower rates than soil applications.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Molybdenum</h1>
<p>Molybdenum (Mo) is a trace element found in the soil, and is required for the synthesis and activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase. Molybdenum is vital for the process of symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation by Rhizobia bacteria in legume root modules. Considering molybdenum’s importance in optimizing plant growth, it's fortunate that Mo deficiencies are relatively rare in most agricultural cropping areas.Recommended molybdenum rates are much lower than those for the other micronutrients, so uniform application is very important. Broadcast application of molybdenized phosphate fertilizers prior to planting or to pastures has been used to correct molybdenum deficiencies. Soluble molybdenum sources also can be sprayed on the soil surface before tillage to obtain a uniform application.

    Seed treatment is the most common method of molybdenum application. Molybdenum sources are coated onto the seed with a sticking agent and/or conditioner. This method ensures a uniform application, and sufficient amounts of molybdenum can be seed coated to provide sufficient molybdenum.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Zinc</h1>
<p>Zinc (Zn) is taken up by plants as the divalent Zn⁺² cation. It was one of the first micronutrients recognized as essential for plants and the one most commonly limiting yields. Although Zn is required only in small amounts, high yields are impossible without it.Recommended rates of zinc generally range from 1 to 10 lb/acre. Band or broadcast applications are used, but foliar applications also are effective. Band applications of zinc sources with starter fertilizers is a common practice for row crops. Foliar sprays of a 0.5% ZnSO₄ solution applied at a rate of 20 to 30 gallons/acre also will supply sufficient zinc, but several applications may be necessary.

    As with copper, residual effects of applied zinc are substantial, with responses found at least 5 years after application. Because of these residual effects, soil test levels of available zinc generally increase after several applications. Many states have reduced their recommended zinc application rates because of these residual effects.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>CHLORINE</h1>
<p>Plants take up chlorine (Cl) as the chloride (Cl-) anion. It’s active in energy reactions in the plant. Most Cl- in soils comes from salt trapped in parent materials, marine aerosols and volcanic emissions. Classified as a micronutrient, Cl- is required by all plants in small quantities.</p>
