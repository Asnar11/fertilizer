<h1>Ammonia</h1>

        <p>
            Anhydrous ammonia is one of the most efficient and widely used sources of nitrogen for plant growth. The advantages of ammonia's relatively easy application and ready availability have led to its increased use as a fertilizer on Missouri farms.

            Anhydrous ammonia also has disadvantages, especially in its handling. It must be stored and handled under high pressure, which requires specially designed and well-maintained equipment. Workers also must be trained to handle this product and to follow strict work procedures to ensure operator safety.
            
            What is anhydrous ammonia (NH3), and why is it so risky to handle? It is a chemical made up of one part nitrogen (N) and three parts hydrogen (H3). The physical properties of this fertilizer make it one of the most potentially dangerous chemicals on the farm.
            
            Anhydrous means without water. Consequently, when anhydrous ammonia and moisture come into contact, they rapidly combine. When it is injected into the soil, the liquid ammonia expands into a gas and is readily absorbed in the soil moisture. Similarly, the liquid or gas that contacts body tissue - especially the eyes, skin and respiratory tract - will cause dehydration, cell destruction and severe chemical burns. Victims exposed to even small amounts of ammonia require immediate treatment to avoid permanent injury.Anhydrous ammonia has a built-in safety factor - you can't stand to breathe it. No one can voluntarily remain in a concentration of anhydrous ammonia gas strong enough to damage the nose, throat, lungs, eyes or skin. When people receive burns or eye damage from the product, it is because of a sudden release of it where the victim is unprotected and cannot escape. Table 1 gives examples of the effects of various concentrations of anhydrous ammonia vapor on the human body.
            Under atmospheric temperature and pressure, anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a sharp, penetrating odor. For use as an agricultural fertilizer, it is compressed into a liquid resembling water. In the liquid state, under pressure, it is stored in specially made tanks strong enough to withstand internal pressures of a minimum of 250 pounds per square inch (psi). As the outside temperatures increase, the temperature of the anhydrous ammonia increases, causing the vapor pressure in the tan to increase. 
            
            Ammonia is corrosive to certain metals and their alloys, such as copper and zinc. Galvanized pipe and brass fittings must not be used with equipment used for storing or applying ammonia. Containers should be made of high-strength steel or other suitable material and fittings should be made of black iron.

        <h1>Urea</h1>
        <p>
 
 
 
 
         Fertilizers provide three primary nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Nitrogen supports vegetative growth. Phosphorus improves roots and flowering. Potassium strengthens resistance to environmental assaults, from extreme temperatures to pest attacks.Urea is the most important nitrogenous fertilizer in the market, with the highest Nitrogen content (about 46 percent). It is a white crystalline organic chemical compound. Urea is neutral in pH and can adapt to almost all kinds of soils. It is a waste product formed naturally by metabolizing protein in humans as well as other mammals, amphibians and some fish. Urea is widely used in the agricultural sector both as a fertilizer and animal feed additive.
 The main function of Urea fertilizer is to provide the plants with nitrogen to promote green leafy growth and make the plants look lush. Urea also aids the photosynthesis process of plants. Since urea fertilizer can provide only nitrogen and not phosphorus or potassium, it’s primarily used for bloom growth.
 
 Superior Nitrogen content
 Low production cost, as source is natural
 Non-flammable and risk-free storage
 Wide application range, for all types of crops and soils
 Neutral pH and harmless to crops and soilUrea should be applied at the time of sowing. It should not come in contact with the seeds. It also can be applied as a top dressing.
 Since Urea is highly Nitrogen-concentrated, it should be used in combination with earth or sand before its application.
 Urea should not be applied when the soil contains free water or likely to remain wet for three or four days after application.

        <h1>UAN</h1>
        <p>


            Solutions of UAN are widely used as a source of N for plant nutrition. The NO₃- portion (25 percent of the total N) is immediately available for plant uptake. The NH₄+ fraction (25 percent of the total N) can also be assimilated directly by most plants, but is rapidly oxidized by soil bacteria to form NO₃- (nitrate). Soil enzymes hydrolyze the remaining urea portion (50 percent of the total N) to form NH₄+, which subsequently transforms to NO₃- in most soil conditions.
Solutions of UAN are extremely versatile as a source of plant nutrition. Its chemical properties, make UAN compatible with many other nutrients and agricultural chemicals, so its frequently mixed with solutions containing phosphorus, potassium and other essential plant nutrients. Fluid fertilizers can be blended to precisely meet the specific needs of a soil or crop.

UAN solutions are commonly injected into the soil beneath the surface, sprayed onto the soil surface, dribbled as a band onto the surface, added to irrigation water, or sprayed onto plant leaves as a source of foliar nutrition. However, UAN may damage foliage if it’s sprayed directly on some plants, so dilution with water may be needed.

Though UAN makes an excellent source of N nutrition for plants, since half of the total N is present as urea, extra management may be required to avoid volatile losses. When UAN remains on the surface of the soil for extended periods (a few days), soil enzymes will convert the urea to ammonium (NH₄+), a portion of which can evaporate as ammonia gas. Therefore, to avoid significant loss, UAN should not remain on the soil surface for more than several days. Inhibitors that slow these N transformations are sometimes added. When UAN is first applied to soil, the urea and the NO₃- molecules will move freely with water in the soil. The NH₄+ will be retained in the soil where it first contacts cation exchange sites on clay or organic matter. Within two to 10 days, most of the urea will be converted to NH₄+ and no longer be mobile. The originally added NH₄+ plus the NH₄+ coming from urea will eventually be converted to NO₃- by soil microorganisms.
