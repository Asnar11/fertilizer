<h1>POTASSIUM SULFATE  </h1>
<p>Potassium is a relatively abundant element in the Earth’s crust, and production of potash fertilizer occurs in every inhabited continent. However, K₂SO₄ is rarely found in a pure form in nature. Instead it is naturally mixed with salts containing magnesium, sodium and chloride (Mg, Na and Cl, respectively). These minerals require additional processing to separate their components. Historically, K₂SO₄ was made by reacting KCl with sulfuric acid. However, researchers later discovered that they could manipulate a number of earth minerals to produce K₂SO₄, now the most common method of production. For example, natural K-containing minerals (such as kainite and schoenite) are mined and carefully rinsed with water and salt solutions to remove byproducts and produce K₂SO₄. The mining industry uses a similar process to harvest K₂SO₄ from the Great Salt Lake in Utah and from underground mineral deposits.
    In New Mexico, K₂SO₄ is separated from langbeinite minerals by reacting it with a solution of KCl, which removes the byproducts (such as Mg) and leaves K₂SO₄. Similar processing techniques are used in many parts of the world, depending on the raw materials accessible.
    
    Potassium is needed to complete many essential functions in plants, such as activating enzyme reactions, synthesizing proteins, forming starch and sugars, and regulating water flow in cells and leaves. Often, concentrations of K in soil are too low to support healthy plant growth.
    
    Potassium sulfate is an excellent source of K nutrition for plants. The K portion of the K₂SO₄ is no different from other common potash fertilizers. However, it also supplies a valuable source of S, which protein synthesis and enzyme function require. Like K, S can also be too deficient for adequate plant growth. Further, Cl- additions should be avoided in certain soils and crops. In such cases, K₂SO₄ makes a very suitable K source.
    
    Potassium sulfate is only one-third as soluble as KCl, so it’s not as commonly dissolved for addition through irrigation water unless there’s a need for additional S.
    
    Several particle sizes are commonly available. Manufacturers produce fine particles (smaller than 0.015 mm) to make solutions for irrigation or foliar sprays, since they dissolve more rapidly.  And growers find foliar spraying of K₂SO₄ a convenient way to apply additional K and S to plants, supplementing the nutrients taken up from the soil.  However, leaf damage can occur if the concentration is too high.</p>

    <h1>POTASSIUM CHLORIDE </h1>
    <p>Deeply buried potash deposits exist throughout the world. The dominant mineral is sylvite mixed with halite (sodium chloride), which forms a mixed mineral called sylvinite. Most K minerals are harvested from ancient marine deposits deep beneath the Earth’s surface. They are then transported to a processing facility where the ore is crushed and the K salts are separated from the sodium salts. The color of KCl can vary from red to white, depending on the source of the sylvinite ore. The reddish tint comes from trace amounts of iron oxide. There are no agronomic differences between the red and white forms of KCl.

        Some KCl is produced by injecting hot water deep into the ground to dissolve the soluble sylvinite mineral and then pumping the brine back to the surface, where the water evaporates. Solar evaporation is used to recover valuable potash salts from brine water in Utah’s Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake, for example.
        
        Potassium chloride is the most widely applied K fertilizer because of its relatively low cost and because it includes more K than most other sources: 50 to 52 percent K (60 to 63 percent K₂O) and 45 to 47 percent Cl⁻.
        
        More than 90 percent of global potash production goes into plant nutrition. Farmers spread KCL onto the soil surface prior to tillage and planting. It may also be applied in a concentrated band near the seed. Since dissolving fertilizer will increase the soluble salt concentration, banded KCl is placed to the side of the seed to avoid damaging the germinating plant.
        
        Potassium chloride rapidly dissolves in soil water. The K⁺ will be retained on the negatively charged cation exchange sites of clay and organic matter. The Cl⁻ portion will readily move with the water. An especially pure grade of KCl can be dissolved for fluid fertilizers or applied through irrigation systems.
        
        Potassium chloride is primarily used as a source of K nutrition. However, there are regions where plants respond favorably to application of Cl⁻. Potassium chloride is usually the preferred material to meet this need. There are no significant impacts on water or air associated with normal application rates of KCl. Elevated salt concentrations surrounding the dissolving fertilizer may be the most important factor to consider.</p>

        POTASSIUM MAGNESIUM SULFATE 
    </h1>
    <p>
        A distinctive geological material, langbeinite exists in only a few locations in the world. Commercial supplies of langbeinite come from underground mines near Carlsbad, N.M., which were first commercially developed in the 1930s. These deposits formed millions of years ago, when a variety of salts, including langbeinite, were left behind after the evaporation of ancient ocean beds. These salt deposits were buried deep beneath hundreds of meters of sediment. The langbeinite deposit is currently mined with large boring machines, washed to remove impurities and then crushed to various particle sizes. Langbeinite is considered a potash (or K-containing) fertilizer, even though it also contains valuable Mg and S. Traces of iron oxide impurities give some langbeinite particles a reddish tint.
Nutrient-dense langbeinite is a popular fertilizer, especially where several nutrients are needed to provide adequate plant nutrition. Its advantage of having K, Mg and S all contained within each of its particles helps provide a uniform distribution of nutrients as farmers spread it through fields. Due to economics, agronomists don’t always recommend langbeinite to meet the entire K requirement of a crop. Instead, application rate may be based on the need for Mg, S, or both.

Langbeinite is water soluble, but dissolves slower than some other common K fertilizers because its particles are denser than other K sources. Therefore, it’s unsuitable for dissolving and applying through irrigation systems unless its finely ground. It has a neutral pH, and does not contribute to soil acidity or alkalinity. This differs from other common Mg sources such as dolomite, which will increase soil pH, and from elemental S or ammonium sulfate, which will lower the soil pH.

Growers frequently choose langbeinite in situations where a fertilizer free of chloride is desirable, such as with crops sensitive to it (like some vegetables and certain tree crops). Another of its qualities is its relatively low overall salt index. Particular sources of langbeinite have been certified for use in organic crop production in some countries.
